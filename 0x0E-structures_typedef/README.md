0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

In this project, we learn what are structures, when, why and how to use them, as well as how to use typedef.
The tasks done in this project are as follows;

0. Poppy - defining a new struct dog with elements
1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself - a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog
A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad - a function that prints a struct dog
3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read - Defines a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.
4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of - a function that creates a new dog.
5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg - a function that frees dogs.
