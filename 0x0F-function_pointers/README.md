0x0F. C - Function pointers

In this project, we learn what function pointers are and how to use them, what a function pointer exactly holds, and where it points to in the virtual memory.

The tasks done are:

0. What's my name - a function that prints a name
1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done - a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities -a function that searches for an integer.
3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at - a program that performs simple operations.
